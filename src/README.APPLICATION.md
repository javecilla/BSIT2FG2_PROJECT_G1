### Application Structure
  - `Java (GUI-jOption)` 
    The java is responsible for handling all server-side logic, database interactions. 
    It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, with a clean separation of concerns 
    thru Object Oriented Programming (OOP)


  - `Source Packages` - The core of the backend application.
    - `config` - Contains all configuration files for the application including database connection.
    - `enums` - Contains predefined constant values for use throughout the application.
    - `interfaces` - Contains overridable methods.
    - `exceptions` - Custom exception classes for handling errors.
    - `helpers` - Utility or helper methods that provide reusable code snippets.
    - `views` - Contains user interface (UI).
    - `controllers` - Contains controllers that handle user requests and return responses.
    - `models` - Entity models representing database tables..
    - `services` - Contains business logic that is more complex than what's in controllers.
